My notes

# Interview Strategies 
- Understand the Problem
- Explore Concrete Examples
- Break it Down
- Solve/Simplify
- Look Back and Refactor 

# Problem Solving Patterns

How Do You Improve? 
1) Devise a plan for solving problems
2) Master Common problem solving patterns

# Some Patterns
- Frequency Counter
- Multiple Pointers 
- Sliding Window
- Divide and Conquer 
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms 
- Backtracking
- Many ore


# Frequency Counters
This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or 0(N^2)n operations with arrays / strings

# Multiple Pointers
Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

# Sliding Window
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number from one position to another. Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a new window is created).
Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string etc

# Divide and Conquer
- thid pattern involves dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process with a subset of data
- this pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity

# Recursion 
- a process (a function in our case ) that calls itself 
- why is it important?
    - used all the time its everywhere
    - json.parse/json.stringify
    - Dom traversal algorithims and document.getElementbyld
    - object traversal 
    - data structures
    - its sometimes cleaner alternative to iteration
